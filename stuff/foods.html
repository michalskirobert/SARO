                                When I eat it with family I eat it with the "śledzie w oleju" - really delicious mixing.
                                I like to put chive in the end of making it :) <br>

                                The most unique taste, and serve method! <br>
                                Traditionally we serve soup inside the bread! Like you can see on the picture :) <br>

                                <b>Ingredients:</b> <br>
                                8.5 cups (2 litres, 0.5 gallon) meat stock (chicken, mixed-meat, rosół works great too)
                                <br>
                                7 oz (200g) unsliced bacon <br>
                                1 (200g, 7 oz) medium white onion <br>
                                2 medium carrots (roughly 4.2 oz, 120g) <br>
                                2 parsley roots (roughly 4.2 oz, 120g) - can be substituted for a celery root) <br>
                                4 links (500g, 1.1 lb) white kiełbasa sausage (fresh, uncooked) <br>
                                2 ¼ cups (500ml) Sour Rye Flour Starter (link to a recipe in the notes) <br>
                                1 garlic clove <br>
                                3 tbsp whipping cream (optional, 30-36% fat) <br>
                                1 tbsp dried marjoram <br>
                                Salt to taste <br>
                                Pepper (freshly ground) to taste <br>
                                IF USING A HOMEMADE 'ZAKWAS' FERMENTED WITHOUT SPICES: <br>
                                4 bay leaves <br>
                                5 all-spice berries <br>
                                5 black peppercorns <br>
                                TO SERVE: <br>
                                4 boiled eggs, halved <br>
                                Fresh marjoram to garnish <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b>

                            <ol class="recipe">
                                <li>Get a cooking pot. Pour in the stock and start heating it up (on a medium heat).
                                </li>
                                <li>Chop bacon and onion into small cubes. Using a frying pan, fry up the bacon first.
                                    There
                                    is
                                    need to add any additional frying fat, bacon will release plenty of its own.</li>
                                <li>Once the bacon fat has rendered, add the onion pieces and continue frying until both
                                    ingredients turn golden.</li>
                                <li>Move the contents of the frying pan into the pot with cooking stock. If your
                                    ‘zakwas’
                                    starter was fermented without spices (that is: bay leaves, all-spice berries and
                                    peppercorns), it’s a good moment to add them directly into the soup. I place them
                                    inside
                                    a
                                    mesh spice bag/stock sachet, so that I don't have to struggle fishing them out
                                    later.
                                </li>
                                <li> Peel carrots and parsley roots, drop them whole into the stock. </li>
                                <li>Add white kiełbasa (uncut, whole links) as well and continue cooking for 30-40
                                    minutes,
                                    until the stock becomes meaty in aroma and flavour (you’ll have to test that
                                    empirically).</li>
                                <li>If you haven’t boiled the eggs already, now is a good moment to do so. Once cooked,
                                    allow
                                    them to cool down.</li>
                                <li>The next step would be to remove the spices. If you used the spice bag, just take it
                                    out.
                                    Otherwise, you can fish them out manually with a spoon, or get rid of them using a
                                    sieve
                                    -
                                    and return the soup into the pot.</li>
                                <li>Now it’s time to add rye 'zakwas' starter. Add 1⅓ cup (300ml) of zakwas for a mild
                                    Żurek, up
                                    to 2 cups (or more; roughly 500ml) for a more sour result. If you’re not sure how
                                    much
                                    you
                                    should add, just pour it over gradually, tasting along the way.

                                <li><i>There are two ways to do it: <br>
                                        • Mix the contents of the jar/bottle, so that the liquid part blends with the
                                        floury
                                        part,
                                        • Or start by adding the liquid only, topping with the muddy floury part later
                                        on -
                                        spoonful
                                        by spoonful, until you reach the desired thickness. That’s how I do it.</i></li>

                                <li>Add 1 tablespoon of dried marjoram and one garlic clove (crushed or roughly
                                    chopped),
                                    cook
                                    for another 4-5 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Remove the pot from heat. Remove the sausage and vegetables with a slotted spoon,
                                    slice
                                    them
                                    all and return to the pot. You can also leave the sausage unsliced - that’s up to
                                    you.
                                </li>
                                <li>Adding cream is optional, but it balances the flavours very nicely. Place 3
                                    tablespoons
                                    of
                                    whipping cream into a cup or a small bowl. Add in a tablespoon of Żurek, mix well
                                    with a
                                    fork. And another spoonful of soup and mix again. Repeat with 2 more tablespoons of
                                    Żurek.
                                    Pour the mixture into the pot.</li>
                                <li>Have a taste. Does it need any more salt or a pinch of pepper? If so, add some to
                                    taste.
                                    Garnish with fresh marjoram or chopped parsley and serve with boiled egg halves.
                                </li>
                                <li>Smacznego!</li>

                                <li>Mash the chops thoroughly with a pestle, turning them from time to time. The

                                    of the cutlets should be about 5 mm. Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper and set
                                    aside. Beat the egg well with a fork in a deep plate. Pour flour into the second

                                    place the chops on the hot fat. Fry until golden brown over low heat.</li>
                                <li>And bonus! Mizeria! Wash the cucumbers, peel them and cut them into thin slices. Put

                                    sliced cucumbers

                                    thoroughly mixed. I put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes.</li>
