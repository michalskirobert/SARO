                            <p>The Witcher (Polish: Wiedźmin [ˈvʲɛd͡ʑmʲin]) is a 2007 action role-playing game developed
                                by CD Projekt Red and published by Atari on Microsoft Windows and CD Projekt on OS X,
                                based on the novel series of The Witcher by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, taking
                                place after the events of the main saga.[4][5] The story takes place in a medieval
                                fantasy world and follows Geralt of Rivia, one of a few traveling monster hunters who
                                have supernatural powers, known as Witchers. The game's system of moral choices as part
                                of the storyline was noted for its time-delayed consequences and lack of black-and-white
                                morality.
                                <br>
                                The game utilizes BioWare's proprietary Aurora Engine. In 2009, a console version, The
                                Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf, was scheduled for release using an entirely new engine
                                and combat system. However, it was suspended as a result of payment problems with
                                console developers Widescreen Games.[6] Two sequels were released: The Witcher 2:
                                Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015.</p><br>

                            <p>Dying Light is an open world first person survival horror action-adventure video game
                                developed by the Polish game studio Techland and published by Warner Bros. Interactive
                                Entertainment. Announced in May 2013, it was released in January 2015 for Microsoft
                                Windows, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game was once planned to be released on
                                PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but was later cancelled due to hardware limitations.
                                <br>
                                The game revolves around an undercover agent named Kyle Crane who is sent to infiltrate
                                a quarantine zone in a city called Harran. It features an enemy-infested, open-world
                                city with a dynamic day and night cycle, with climbable structures that support a fluid
                                parkour system. The day-night cycle changes the game drastically, as the zombies become
                                more aggressive and more difficult to deal with during night time. The gameplay is
                                focused on weapons-based combat and parkour. The game also features an asymmetrical
                                multiplayer mode (originally set to be a pre-order bonus), and a four-player
                                co-operative multiplayer mode.
                                <br>
                                The development of the game began in early 2012. Prior to the game's official
                                announcement, several reports claimed that Dying Light was a sequel to Dead Island,
                                another franchise created by Techland, but that rumor was later denied. The game's
                                parkour system puts emphasis on natural movement. To implement that, Techland had to
                                abandon most of the story elements and build them again from scratch. The music
                                development was handled by Paweł Błaszczak. According to him, the soundtrack was
                                inspired by movie soundtracks of the '70s and '80s.
                                <br>
                                At release, Dying Light received positive reviews from critics, with praise mainly
                                directed at the combat, graphics, co-operative multiplayer, navigation and the day-night
                                cycle, while receiving criticism regarding the story, difficulty, and technical issues.
                                The game was the best-selling title for the month of January 2015 and broke the record
                                for the first month sales for a new survival horror intellectual property. Techland
                                announced that they would be committed to the game after its release. As a result, in
                                May 2015, they put another project on hold to concentrate on the post-release
                                development of Dying Light. The team released numerous updates, and two downloadable
                                content (DLC) packages, namely Cuisine & Cargo and The Bozak Horde. An expansion, titled
                                Dying Light: The Following, was announced as well and was released on February 9, 2016..
