                                        <p>The Warsaw Uprising (Polish: Powstanie Warszawskie; German: Warschauer
                                            Aufstand) was a
                                            major
                                            World War II operation, in the summer of 1944, by the Polish underground
                                            resistance, led
                                            by
                                            the Polish resistance Home Army (Polish: Armia Krajowa), to liberate Warsaw
                                            from German
                                            occupation. The uprising was timed to coincide with the retreat of the
                                            German forces
                                            from
                                            Poland ahead of the Soviet advance. While approaching the eastern suburbs of
                                            the city,
                                            the Red Army temporarily halted combat operations, enabling the Germans to
                                            regroup and
                                            defeat the Polish resistance and to destroy the city in retaliation. The
                                            Uprising was
                                            fought
                                            for 63 days with little outside support. It was the single largest military
                                            effort taken
                                            by
                                            any European resistance movement during World War II. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            The Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide Operation
                                            Tempest, launched
                                            at
                                            the time of the Soviet Lublin–Brest Offensive. The main Polish objectives
                                            were to drive
                                            the
                                            Germans out of Warsaw while helping the Allies defeat Germany. An
                                            additional, political
                                            goal
                                            of the Polish Underground State was to liberate Poland's capital and assert
                                            Polish
                                            sovereignty before the Soviet-backed Polish Committee of National Liberation
                                            could
                                            assume
                                            control. Other immediate causes included a threat of mass German round-ups
                                            of
                                            able-bodied
                                            Poles for "evacuation"; calls by Radio Moscow's Polish Service for uprising;
                                            and an
                                            emotional Polish desire for justice and revenge against the enemy after five
                                            years of
                                            German
                                            occupation. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Initially, the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw, but
                                            the Soviets
                                            ignored Polish attempts to make radio contact with them and did not advance
                                            beyond the
                                            city
                                            limits. Intense street fighting between the Germans and Poles continued. By
                                            14
                                            September,
                                            the eastern bank of the Vistula River opposite the Polish resistance
                                            positions was taken
                                            over by the Polish troops fighting under the Soviet command; 1,200 men made
                                            it across
                                            the
                                            river, but they were not reinforced by the Red Army. This, and the lack of
                                            air support
                                            from
                                            the Soviet air base five-minutes flying time away, led to allegations that
                                            Joseph Stalin
                                            tactically halted his forces to let the operation fail and allow the Polish
                                            resistance
                                            to be
                                            crushed. Arthur Koestler called the Soviet attitude "one of the major
                                            infamies of this
                                            war
                                            which will rank for the future historian on the same ethical level with
                                            Lidice." <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Winston Churchill pleaded with Stalin and Franklin D. Roosevelt to help
                                            Britain's Polish
                                            allies, to no avail. Then, without Soviet air clearance, Churchill sent over
                                            200
                                            low-level supply drops by the Royal Air Force, the South African Air Force,
                                            and the
                                            Polish
                                            Air Force under British High Command, in an operation known as the Warsaw
                                            Airlift.
                                            Later,
                                            after gaining Soviet air clearance, the U.S. Army Air Force sent one
                                            high-level mass
                                            airdrop
                                            as part of Operation Frantic. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Although the exact number of casualties is unknown, it is estimated that
                                            about 16,000
                                            members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6,000 badly wounded.
                                            In addition,
                                            between 150,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians died, mostly from mass
                                            executions. Jews
                                            being
                                            harboured by Poles were exposed by German house-to-house clearances and mass

                                            of
                                            entire neighbourhoods. German casualties totalled over 2,000 to 17,000
                                            soldiers killed
                                            and
                                            missing. During the urban combat, approximately 25% of Warsaw's buildings
                                            were
                                            destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces, German troops
                                            systematically
                                            levelled

                                            city was
                                            destroyed by January 1945 when the course of the events in the Eastern Front
                                            forced the
                                            Germans to abandon the city.</p>
