                                <p>Over 80% of Poles are Christians. Therefore on November 1st, the All Saint’s Day, the
                                    roads are filled with people going to visit graves of their deceased relatives. Many
                                    travel across the country to their hometowns on that day. There is a special mass in
                                    the intention of all the christians’ souls, which have attained salvation and are in
                                    heaven.

                                    <p>It’s strictly connected with All Souls’ Day, November 2nd, on which the prayers
                                        go to all the souls. On All Souls’ Day there is a procession around the church
                                        or a graveyard, which includes five stations, on which the church members pray
                                        for the deceased bishops and priests, relatives, benefactors and all the dead.
                                        On both of those days graveyards are full of flowers and lit up with candles.

                                        The night between All Saint’s Day and All Souls’ Day, also known as All Souls’
                                        Night or <i>Dziady</i>, always played a special role in the imagination and folk
                                        rituals. It was believed that on that night beings from the beyond could
                                        influence reality. The souls of the dead were freed from the purgatory and
                                        wandered along crossroads and cemeteries - looking for help, prayer or
                                        sacrifice. Fires were made in farmyards and gravesites to show them the way
                                        home, as it was believed the souls were going to visit places they lived during
                                        their lifetime or where their bodies were buried. It was believed that it was
                                        dangerous to leave home that night and even in the 19th century, people were
                                        still afraid to leave their homes on All Souls’ Night. They did not travel or
                                        visit their neighbors, as not every ghost had to have good intentions. Also
                                        people steered clear of the churches as the deceased priests were to celebrate
                                        mass for the dead. In many churches the missal was left on the altar and the
                                        temple doors were opened for that night.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The taverns were closed and music and singing were forbidden on All Souls’
                                        Night, but other celebrations were taking place. In awaitance for the visit from
                                        the souls, food and alcohol was prepared and left either on the thresholds or
                                        the tombstones. Various activities like smacking butter, trampling cabbage,
                                        weaving and pouring washes or spitting were forbidden as it could disturb the
                                        souls or even threaten them. It was believed that in the ghost hour, the souls
                                        were giving signs of their presence by knocking, creaking floors and equipment,
                                        opening gates and doors or tracing the ashes. Sometimes they appeared as
                                        shadows, fires or lights or even took their former form. In western Poland it
                                        was tradition to feast either at home or on the gravesites to ensure the favors
                                        from the dead and help them achieve peace. In eastern Poland the food and gifts
                                        were brought to the churches and cemeteries for the beggars, asking them to pray
                                        for the deceased relatives of the giver, as it was believed that the ghost can
                                        take the form of a beggar.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Right now the <i>Dziady</i> traditions are mostly forgotten and best known from
                                        Adam Mickiewicz’s drama of this title. Although the candles on the tombstones
                                        derive from fires, lit to show souls the way home, and you can’t meet many
                                        people in the cemeteries on the night of November 1st.

                                    <p>The Warsaw Uprising (Polish: Powstanie Warszawskie; German: Warschauer
                                        Aufstand) was a
                                        major
                                        World War II operation, in the summer of 1944, by the Polish underground
                                        resistance, led
                                        by
                                        the Polish resistance Home Army (Polish: Armia Krajowa), to liberate Warsaw
                                        from German
                                        occupation. The uprising was timed to coincide with the retreat of the
                                        German forces
                                        from
                                        Poland ahead of the Soviet advance. While approaching the eastern suburbs of
                                        the city,
                                        the Red Army temporarily halted combat operations, enabling the Germans to
                                        regroup and
                                        defeat the Polish resistance and to destroy the city in retaliation. The
                                        Uprising was
                                        fought
                                        for 63 days with little outside support. It was the single largest military
                                        effort taken
                                        by
                                        any European resistance movement during World War II. <br>

                                        The Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide Operation
                                        Tempest, launched
                                        at
                                        the time of the Soviet Lublin–Brest Offensive. The main Polish objectives
                                        were to drive
                                        the
                                        Germans out of Warsaw while helping the Allies defeat Germany. An
                                        additional, political
                                        goal
                                        of the Polish Underground State was to liberate Poland's capital and assert
                                        Polish
                                        sovereignty before the Soviet-backed Polish Committee of National Liberation
                                        could
                                        assume
                                        control. Other immediate causes included a threat of mass German round-ups
                                        of
                                        able-bodied
                                        Poles for "evacuation"; calls by Radio Moscow's Polish Service for uprising;
                                        and an
                                        emotional Polish desire for justice and revenge against the enemy after five
                                        years of
                                        German
                                        occupation. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Initially, the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw, but
                                        the Soviets
                                        ignored Polish attempts to make radio contact with them and did not advance
                                        beyond the
                                        city
                                        limits. Intense street fighting between the Germans and Poles continued. By
                                        14
                                        September,
                                        the eastern bank of the Vistula River opposite the Polish resistance
                                        positions was taken
                                        over by the Polish troops fighting under the Soviet command; 1,200 men made
                                        it across
                                        the
                                        river, but they were not reinforced by the Red Army. This, and the lack of
                                        air support
                                        from
                                        the Soviet air base five-minutes flying time away, led to allegations that
                                        Joseph Stalin
                                        tactically halted his forces to let the operation fail and allow the Polish
                                        resistance
                                        to be
                                        crushed. Arthur Koestler called the Soviet attitude "one of the major
                                        infamies of this
                                        war
                                        which will rank for the future historian on the same ethical level with
                                        Lidice." <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Winston Churchill pleaded with Stalin and Franklin D. Roosevelt to help
                                        Britain's Polish
                                        allies, to no avail. Then, without Soviet air clearance, Churchill sent over
                                        200
                                        low-level supply drops by the Royal Air Force, the South African Air Force,
                                        and the
                                        Polish
                                        Air Force under British High Command, in an operation known as the Warsaw
                                        Airlift.
                                        Later,
                                        after gaining Soviet air clearance, the U.S. Army Air Force sent one
                                        high-level mass
                                        airdrop
                                        as part of Operation Frantic. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Although the exact number of casualties is unknown, it is estimated that
                                        about 16,000
                                        members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6,000 badly wounded.
                                        In addition,
                                        between 150,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians died, mostly from mass
                                        executions. Jews
                                        being
                                        harboured by Poles were exposed by German house-to-house clearances and mass
                                        evictions
                                        of
                                        entire neighbourhoods. German casualties totalled over 2,000 to 17,000
                                        soldiers killed
                                        and
                                        missing. During the urban combat, approximately 25% of Warsaw's buildings
                                        were
                                        destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces, German troops
                                        systematically
                                        levelled
                                        another 35% of the city block by block. Together with earlier damage
                                        suffered in the
                                        1939
                                        invasion of Poland and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943, over 85% of the
                                        city was
                                        destroyed by January 1945 when the course of the events in the Eastern Front
                                        forced the
                                        Germans to abandon the city.
